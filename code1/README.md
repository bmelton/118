# Code 1

The [first code](https://www.reddit.com/r/118/comments/4mqhog/recap_for_662016_pt_1/)
seems to be fairly straightforward, though possibly there's something in the title 
that is needed for later. 

In the "Recap for 6-6-2016 pt 1" thread, there is a message: 

> 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

Noting that the As and Hs are not simply alternating character strings, they 
seem to be holding places for bits, e.g., binary.  For that, I wrote a quick 
and dirty binary to ascii transformer.  First, it transforms the As and Hs
into 0s and 1s, then it unhexlifies the result of that operation. 

What we end up with is this: 

> ?????ߙ????ЍМ???????߈??؋ߓ???ߗ???ߝ??????߆??ߐ???ߗ????????ߐ?߈???

That doesn't make any sense, so I reversed the bit assignments, and the 
new result is: 

> Those from /r/counting won't last here because you only have 1000 of what

AHA!  That makes sense.  Glad to have one knocked out.  But uhmmm, what is 
/r/counting?  Turns out, it's a place where people go to count.  For example, 
you can go to the [1,483k Counting Thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/counting/comments/5bbmr5/1483k_counting_thread/)
and see that somebody starts the post at 1,483,000, and the first reply is 
1,483,001, then 1,483,002, etc.  This is the thread immediately after 1,482k,
but before you think it's just boring ass numerals being counted, I should let
you know that there are counting threads for hex, binary, hexadecimal, Grecian
alphabet base 48, etc.  

Anyway, the answer to the riddle seems like it might be 'comments'.  If you're
a member of the /r/counting thread, presumably, you'd have a lot of comments. 
Reddit, being what it is, only allows the past 1,000 threads of a given user
to exist in the live database.  After that, they won't appear on the user's 
profile, but will instead be active only in the 'read-only' archived threads.

So, if you're from /r/counting (which, apparently there were two members from)
you're more likely to get uninvited from /r/118 because... why?  Because the 
118 moderator bot purges users from 118 if it does not detect a comment from 
you in the 118 subreddit on your profile. 

So, apparently the first code simply gives us some insight as to how it works. 
Time will tell if that's meaningful.  

What I'm wondering now is if there's any significance to the "pt 1" in the 
thread title.  For [Code 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/118/comments/4nj0b8/recap_for_1062016_fmdkufutdngfmdody/), 
the thread title has "Recap <the date>", and then has a code in parentheses, 
"(fmdkufutdngfmdody)".  

That proves meaningful later, so I'm not yet ready to discard the "pt 1" in 
the Code 1 title.  If I later find a recap with "pt 2" in the thread title, 
I might be willing to let it go.
