118 is a secret subreddit that is... well, mysterious.  Apparently, only 
invitees are allowed to post there, and invitations are, near as anyone
can tell, completely random.  There is a weekly culling, in which some people
are disinvited while others remain. Participation and/or success *might* be
a reason for continued invitation, or it might not be.

The *purpose* of 118 is apparently to "solve the codes".  There are a variety
of codes in the sub, some obvious, some less so.  

This repository is for the solving of the clues where it is appropriate to 
use tools for solving them.  It is possible that the creation of these tools
will result in my being disinvited.  We'll see.
